title: "Service Placement Using Distributed Pure Exploration in Linear Bandits"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/EUSIPCO
excerpt: ' The service placement problem in mobile edge computing focuses on determining which services to deploy at the network edge to maximize the quality of service. This problem is challenging because of the unknown service demand and network uncertainty. In this paper, we model the service demand as a linear function of the service attributes and formulate the problem as a linear bandit. We propose a novel distributed and adaptive multi-agent best arm identification algorithm under the fixed-confidence setting for linear bandits. The numerical results show that our algorithm solves the service placement problem with high confidence and leverages agent collaboration to achieve a near-optimal speedup. We also derive the theoretical upper bound on the sample complexity and communication overhead.'

The service placement problem in mobile edge computing focuses on determining which services to deploy at the network edge to maximize the quality of service. This problem is challenging because of the unknown service demand and network uncertainty. In this paper, we model the service demand as a linear function of the service attributes and formulate the problem as a linear bandit. We propose a novel distributed and adaptive multi-agent best arm identification algorithm under the fixed-confidence setting for linear bandits. The numerical results show that our algorithm solves the service placement problem with high confidence and leverages agent collaboration to achieve a near-optimal speedup. We also derive the theoretical upper bound on the sample complexity and communication overhead.
