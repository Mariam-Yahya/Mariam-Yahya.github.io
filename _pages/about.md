======
I am a final-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of TÃ¼bingen, where I joined the Decision Making Group in October 2020. The group has since relocated to Ruhr University Bochum. With a background in wireless communications, my research interests lie at the intersection of communication systems, online learning, and distributed learning. My work focuses on designing and applying algorithms to optimize the performance of communication systems operating under high uncertainty within increasingly autonomous and heterogeneous networks.
